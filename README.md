2048 is a popular single-player game for Web and mobile. It’s a type of “sliding block puzzle”. Like Sudoku, it also involves some math. The object of the game is to combine the numbers displayed on the tiles until you reach 2048 or just having the best score.

The score is calculated each time the player merges two blocs. A merge adds to the score the addition of the two blocs.
